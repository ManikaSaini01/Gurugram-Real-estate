Gurugram Real Estate Price Predictor & Apartment Recommender

This project is an end-to-end data science solution that analyzes residential real estate data from Gurugram to help users make informed property decisions. It features a Machine Learning–based Price Predictor that estimates the fair value of an apartment using factors like location, area, bedrooms, and amenities, and a Similarity-Based Recommender System that suggests properties similar to the user’s selected listing.

The project includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, model building, and deployment using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to explore insights interactively.
